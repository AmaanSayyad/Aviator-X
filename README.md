### Challenges

Ensuring fair play in the casino games was critical, and implementing on-chain randomness was a significant challenge. Utilized Aptos randomness module: aptos_framework::randomness to achieve provably fair outcomes for our games. This required a deep understanding of the randomness mechanisms and careful integration into our smart contracts. All though the docs provided by the Aptos were super useful.

- Setting up the DeFi part also posed challenges, as contemplated creating our own platform token APTC.

- Time constraints did not allowed us for implementing gasless transactions but we prioritized delivering a functional and reliable platform.
